      <div class="art-card">
        <h5>1. Mandala</h5>
        <p>
          Mandala art is a symbolic circular design that originated in Hindu and Buddhist traditions 
          to represent the universe's wholeness and interconnectedness. The term “mandala” means “circle” in Sanskrit. 
          These artworks typically feature intricate geometric patterns radiating from a central point and were traditionally 
          used for meditation and sacred rituals. Creating mandalas is popular today for its meditative and therapeutic benefits, 
          promoting focus, mindfulness, and relaxation.
        </p>

      <div class="art-card">
        <h5>2. Madhubani (Mithila)</h5>
        <p>
          A folk art tradition from Bihar’s Mithila region, characterized by intricate line work and vibrant fills. 
          Traditionally painted on mud walls and floors, it is now created on paper, cloth, and canvas using fingers, twigs, 
          brushes, and nib pens. Themes span mythology, nature, and daily life, featuring motifs like deities, animals, flowers, 
          and geometric patterns, often coloured with natural dyes derived from turmeric, henna, and charcoal.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="art-card">
        <h5>3. Gond</h5>
        <p>
          A tribal art form from the Gond community of Central India known for its intricate patterns of dots and lines, 
          vibrant colours and imaginative depictions of nature, mythology, and folklore. Traditionally it was created on mud walls 
          using natural materials like charcoal, clay and plant pigments. Modern Gond art is still created with these traditional methods 
          and natural colors but is also frequently produced on paper and canvas using acrylic paints.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="art-card">
        <h5>4. Kalamkari</h5>
        <p>
          An ancient Indian textile art from Andhra Pradesh that involves handpainting or block printing intricate designs 
          on cotton or silk fabric using natural dyes. The name comes from the Persian words <em>kalam</em> (pen) and <em>kari</em> (craftsmanship), 
          referencing the use of a tamarind pen for freehand drawing.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="art-card">
        <h5>5. Pichwai</h5>
        <p>
          A traditional art form from Rajasthan consisting of intricate cloth paintings that traditionally served as backdrops 
          for the idol of Srinathji, a form of Lord Krishna. The word <em>Pichwai</em> comes from <em>Pich</em> (back) and <em>Wai</em> (hanging). 
          The art features vibrant colors and detailed depictions of scenes from Lord Krishna’s life, often with Gopis, Cows, and Lotuses.
